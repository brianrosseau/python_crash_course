# Python Crash Course
## A Hands-on, Project-based Introduction to Programming

Python Crash Course, 3rd edition, is a book by Eric Matthes that teaches Python programming language. 

I completed all of the exercises and two of the projects. This page is to display what I learned while going through this excellent book.

The book is divided into two sections: Basics and Projects.

Some of the things I learned in Basics includes Lists, If Statements, Dictionaries, User Input, While Loops, Functions, Classes, Files and Exceptions, and Testing your Code.

Project 1 consisted of programming a game called Alien Invasion.

Project 2 was a number of Data Visualization projects.
