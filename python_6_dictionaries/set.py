# SET
## you can build a set directly (different from a list, tuple, or dictionary)
## use curly brackets and separate the elements with commas
languages = {'python', 'rust', 'python', 'c'}
languages

## a set eliminates duplicates
## be careful not confuse dictionaries, which also have curly brackets
## dictionaries have key-value pairs; sets do not
## unlike lists and dictionaries, sets do not retain any specific order
